/* ============================================================================
 * SOTI AI Analyser — Copilot Browser Bridge (relay content script)
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The "no API key" path. Microsoft 365 Copilot has no public completions
 * endpoint — you cannot POST a prompt to it the way sidepanel.js POSTs to Ollama.
 * What it does have is a web app the engineer is already signed in to. This
 * script is injected INTO that tab, types the panel's prompt into the composer,
 * watches the answer render, and streams the text back to the side panel over
 * extension messaging. The user's existing SSO session does the authenticating,
 * so there is no key to configure and none to leak.
 *
 * Injected ON DEMAND (chrome.scripting.executeScript from ai-provider.js), never
 * declared in the manifest — so it does not run in anyone's Copilot tab unless
 * the bridge provider has been selected and the host permission granted.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW IT FINDS THE ANSWER — and why it is not a list of CSS selectors
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious implementation is a table of selectors per site. It is also the
 * one that breaks every time a vendor ships a redesign, and it fails SILENTLY:
 * a selector that matches nothing returns empty text, which looks exactly like
 * "the model said nothing".
 *
 * So selectors are the FALLBACK here, not the mechanism. The primary strategy
 * knows nothing about any site's markup:
 *
 *   1. Before sending, start a MutationObserver over the whole document and
 *      remember every element that changes from this moment on.
 *   2. After sending, the answer is — by construction — among those elements.
 *      Narrow them by two structural facts that hold on every chat UI ever
 *      built, without naming a single class:
 *        · the answer is NOT inside the composer, and no ancestor of the
 *          composer is the answer (that excludes <body> and every page wrapper);
 *        · the answer does NOT contain the prompt we just sent (that excludes
 *          the user's own message bubble, and any wrapper holding both turns).
 *      Whatever is left with the most text IS the assistant's turn.
 *   3. Then tighten: descend into the largest child that still holds ~all of
 *      that text, which strips "Copy / Regenerate / Was this helpful" chrome
 *      off the edges without knowing those words.
 *
 * The prompt carries a distinctive "=== INSTRUCTIONS ===" header partly so step
 * 2's second test has something unambiguous to match on.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT IS EVENT-DRIVEN, NOT POLLED
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The relay tab runs in the BACKGROUND. Chrome clamps setTimeout/setInterval in
 * hidden tabs to roughly once per second and can freeze a tab that sits idle, so
 * a polling loop would crawl exactly when a long answer needs it least.
 * MutationObserver callbacks are not throttled that way, so the observer drives
 * the streaming and the timer exists only as a safety net.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE COMPOSER LIMIT IS NOT THE CONTEXT LIMIT
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A message box caps how much can be typed AT ONCE. A conversation caps nothing
 * — remembering what came before is the entire point of a chat UI. So a case too
 * big for the box is not too big for the model: the adapter splits it into PARTS
 * that each fit, sends them as consecutive messages, and only the last one asks a
 * question. Everything before it is reference material the model is already
 * holding. That is what turned a ~5,400-character prompt budget into an ~88,000
 * one without raising a single site's limit.
 *
 * Two rules make it safe rather than merely bigger. Every part must be ECHOED
 * back before the next is typed — a part the page silently dropped would leave a
 * hole in the case that nothing downstream could detect. And the page must go
 * IDLE between parts, because typing into a composer that is still streaming
 * loses the text without an error.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT STILL CANNOT PROMISE
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  1. The conversation's own window is finite and invisible. Parts are counted
 *     and bounded so the total stays well inside it, but if a site compacts an
 *     early turn there is no way to see that from the DOM.
 *  2. The text is read back from RENDERED HTML. Markdown that re-renders mid
 *     stream can rewrite text already emitted — see reconcile() at the end of
 *     runRequest() for how that is handled and what it costs.
 *  3. Driving a chat UI programmatically is a different thing, contractually,
 *     from calling a documented API, and these prompts carry customer data.
 *     Check your organisation's acceptable-use terms.

     * panel flattens a bundle into ONE .txt carrying every inner file behind
     * "=== FILE: <path> ===" markers — the same markers the prompt already uses, and
     * the model attributes findings to the right inner file from them.
     *
     * Three things make this safe rather than merely bigger:
     *  · the input is HIDDEN, so it is found by type and by what it accepts, never by
     *    visible();
     *  · anything already attached is REMOVED first — an attachment outlives "New
     *    chat" here, so last case's bundle would otherwise join this one's evidence;
     *  · the upload must FINISH before anything is typed. Sending while a chip is
     *    still spinning submits the question without the evidence, and the answer that

     * READING THE ANSWER BACK AS MARKDOWN, NOT AS FLAT TEXT
     * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     * The relay used to hand the panel `innerText`, and innerText is lossy in exactly the
     * places a support report cares about. Measured against a live M365 Copilot answer:
     *
     *   <ol> → "First item\nSecond item"          — the NUMBERS are gone. List markers are
     *                                               drawn by CSS, and CSS is not text.
     *   <table> → "Item\tValue\nProduct\tMobiControl"
     *                                             — TAB separated. Not one pipe survives.
     *
     * The panel then renders that faithfully as what it is: unnumbered lines and a run of
     * tab-separated words where a table should be. Nothing downstream can recover the
     * structure, because by then the structure is genuinely gone.
     *
     * So the DOM is walked and written back out as markdown. Copilot rendered markdown to
     * build this DOM; turning it back into markdown is simply the inverse, and it is what
     * makes the panel's rendering match what the engineer sees in the Copilot tab.
     *
     * Falls back to innerText on any error — a formatted answer is better than a flat one,
     * but a flat answer is enormously better than none.

     * a line that merely looks numeric but breaks the run.
     *
     * The widget is also VIRTUALISED (scriptor-codeblock-virt): a long block keeps only the
     * visible lines in the DOM behind a "Show more lines" control. What is missing cannot be

     * WHAT IS LEFT TO SAY — the tail of an answer that has already been streamed
     * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Nothing streamed can be un-said, so the final reconcile can only ever APPEND. The
     * question is where the append starts, and a raw character comparison answers it wrongly
     * whenever the page changed the SHAPE of the answer between the last streamed read and
     * the finished one — which it routinely does, because a half-rendered reply is not
     * marked up the same way as a complete one.
     *
     * That is what put a case summary on screen twice: once as a ladder of single words and
     * then again, whole, underneath. The two texts said the same thing and shared barely a
     * dozen leading characters, so "append from the common prefix" appended the entire
     * answer a second time.
     *
     * So the comparison is made on a projection with the shape taken out — no whitespace,
     * no markdown markers — carrying an index map back into the real text. Same words in the
     * same order means the finished text is a CONTINUATION of what was streamed, however
     * differently it is now laid out, and only the genuinely new characters are sent.
     * Anything else is a real divergence, where repeating a little text is still cheaper
     * than losing the end of the answer.
