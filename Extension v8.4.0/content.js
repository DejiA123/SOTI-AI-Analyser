/* ============================================================================
 * SOTI AI Analyser — Salesforce Content Script
 * ============================================================================
 * A "content script" is JavaScript that Chrome injects INTO another web page —
 * here, Salesforce (see manifest.json "content_scripts"). Its job: read the open
 * case's fields off the Salesforce page and send them to our side panel, so the
 * engineer doesn't have to retype the case number, product, version, etc.
 *
 * Why scrape the page instead of using the Salesforce API? The API needs OAuth,
 * admin setup, and credentials; scraping the already-open page needs none of that.
 * The trade-off: if Salesforce changes its HTML, the selectors below may need
 * updating. (Full rationale in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md §5.8.)
 *
 * The tricky parts, and the helpers that handle them:
 *   • Salesforce hides fields inside "Shadow DOM" (isolated DOM sub-trees) →
 *     findInShadows() / findElementByIdInShadows() walk into those sub-trees.
 *   • Background tabs are moved off-screen, not removed → isVisible() filters them.
 *   • Field text is jammed together with button labels
 *     (e.g. "Acme CorpOpen Preview Edit") → cleanFieldValue() strips the noise.
 *   • scrapeSalesforce() ties it together; the onMessage listener at the bottom
 *     responds when the side panel asks for a scrape.
 * ============================================================================ */

/* THE WORKSPACE TAB THAT HOLDS ONE NAMED RECORD — the deterministic version of the

 *
 * getActiveWorkspaceRoot scores containers and picks a winner, which is the best that can
 * be done when nothing has said which case is meant. But the console keeps EVERY open case
 * in the DOM at once — a background workspace tab is hidden, not unmounted, and it keeps
 * all its fields, its sub-tab bar and its feed — so a guess that lands one tab to the left
 * reads a different case's record and answers with perfect confidence. That is exactly what
 * "Add Case → From the Salesforce tab" was doing: with four cases open it added the first
 * one in the tab row rather than the one on screen.
 *
 * The address bar already names the active record (in the console the PATH is the record
 * and `?ws=` is the workspace), so the panel can simply say which id it means, and the
 * console's own tab bar maps that id to its panel: the tab anchor's href carries the record
 * and its aria-controls names the container the record is rendered into. No scoring, no
 * visibility guesswork — the markup states the answer.
 *
 * Returns null when the id is not in a console tab bar at all, which is the ordinary case
 * for a record opened on its own page: the caller falls back to the heuristic and then to
 * the whole document, and both are right there.

 * chain and silently misses everything before it. So before scraping we drive
 * the feed's own infinite scroll to the end.
 *
 * Two things make this fiddly:
 *   • The Lightning Console does NOT scroll `window`. The feed sits inside a
 *     nested scroller (.forceChatterScroller, the workspace tab body, ...), so
 *     window.scrollTo() does nothing. We walk up from a real feed item and
 *     scroll every scrollable ancestor we find.
 *   • There is no reliable "end of feed" flag — the "End of Feed" marker is in
 *     the DOM even when more posts can still load. We stop when the post count
 *     stops growing for a few rounds instead, with hard round/time caps so a
 *     slow or enormous case can never hang the sync.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IS ATTACHED TO THE EMAILS ON THIS CASE
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The customer sends a log bundle, a screenshot of the error, a config export — and every one
 * of them arrives as a link in the case feed, where the sync could see it and did nothing with
 * it. So the evidence the case turns on sat two clicks away in Salesforce while the AI was
 * told only about whatever the engineer had separately downloaded and dragged in.
 *
 * This reads the LINKS, not the files. Nothing is fetched here: a content script has the
 * page's session and could pull every attachment on a long case in one go, which is a lot of
 * traffic and a lot of memory for files nobody asked for. The panel gets a list, offers it to
 * the engineer, and downloads only what they pick — see the attachment picker after a sync.
 *
 * THREE THINGS SALESFORCE CALLS AN ATTACHMENT, and they render differently:
 *
 *   · a ContentDocument (the modern one) — /sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/068…
 *     or /sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069…
 *   · a classic Attachment — /servlet/servlet.FileDownload?file=00P…
 *   · an INLINE IMAGE inside the email body, which is an <img> whose src is one of the above.
 *     Those are the screenshots — "here is what the console shows" — and they are the ones
 *     worth OCR'ing, which is why `kind` distinguishes them rather than lumping everything
 *     together as a file.
 *
 * A name is not guaranteed. Salesforce puts one on the link title on most layouts and on none
 * of them reliably, so a missing name falls back to the file id — which is at least unique and
 * at least tells the engineer the two attachments are different files.
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/* EVERY SHAPE A SALESFORCE FILE LINK COMES IN.
 *
 * The old rule was one regular expression over two URL shapes — the shepherd download and the
 * classic FileDownload servlet — and it is why a customer's five log files arrived in the
 * picker as one, and why a screenshot pasted into the body of an email was not offered at all.
 * Neither of those renders as a plain download link on a modern case feed:
 *
 *   · a file CARD links to the record, not the file: /lightning/r/ContentDocument/069…/view
 *   · a file card's thumbnail is a RENDITION: …/version/renditionDownload?…&versionId=068…
 *   · an image pasted INTO the email body is served by the rich-text servlet:
 *     /servlet/rtaImage?eid=…&feoid=Body&refid=0EM… — a shape with no file id in the path at
 *     all, which is exactly the "image in the email body, not an attachment" case
 *   · and some layouts put the id in a data- attribute and give the anchor href="javascript:void(0)"
 *
 * So the id is extracted from whichever of those a URL turns out to be, and every entry is
 * reduced to a CANONICAL download URL — the one shape that actually returns the file's bytes.
 * A thumbnail rendition is 120x90 pixels of a screenshot: OCR'ing one reads nothing, so a
 * rendition is rewritten to the full download of the same version rather than fetched as-is.

 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * file more than one id depending on which of its own objects is rendering it:
 *
 *   · the file CARD links to the ContentDocument — 069…
 *   · the card's thumbnail is a ContentVersion   — 068…
 *   · a screenshot pasted into the body is served by the rich-text servlet — rta:0EM…
 *
 * There is no way to tell from the page that 069x and 068y are the same document — the
 * mapping lives in Salesforce, not in the DOM — so the picker offered one screenshot twice:
 * once as an image and once as a file, with the same name on both rows. Ticking both
 * downloads the same bytes twice and sends one copy to OCR and the other down the log path,
 * where it lands as a page of binary.
 *
 * So a SECOND identity is matched on: the file's own name, within one email. Two entries are
 * the same file when their names agree and nothing about where they came from contradicts it
 * — the same sender, the same post time, or silence on one side (the page-wide sweep at the
 * bottom of readFeedAttachments knows neither). A name only counts when Salesforce actually
 * gave us one: the fallbacks ("Salesforce file 069…", "Inline image 2", "Attachment") are
 * placeholders, and merging on those would collapse genuinely different files into one row.
 *
 * THE EXTENSION IS PART OF THE NAME, with one exception. "logs.zip" and "logs.txt" are two
 * files and must stay two rows. But the same screenshot is named with and without its
 * extension by the card and the <img> that renders it, so an image extension — and only an
 * image extension — is dropped before comparing.

 * there is no feed anywhere in the DOM: the loader above reports "no-feed-found",
 * not one post is scraped, and the panel says "no email chain was found — open the

 *
 * So the sync opens the tab itself. Three rules keep that from becoming a nuisance
 * of its own:
 *
 *   • It only clicks when no feed is on screen. On a case already showing its Feed
 *     — the common case — nothing is touched and nothing moves.
 *   • It runs AFTER the fields have been read (see scrapeSalesforce). Leaving a
 *     sub-tab unmounts it, so opening the Feed first would trade an empty chain
 *     for empty case fields.
 *   • It matches the tab by its LABEL, never by `data-tab-value`. Those values
 *     ("flexipage_tab3") are assigned per layout — the number differs between orgs

 * THE NPS AVERAGES — a Flow screen, not a record field
 * ===========================================================================
 * "NPS Score (90 Days Avg)" and "NPS Score (365 Days Avg)" are not on the record layout.
 * They are rendered by a Flow inside an accordion headed "Net Promoter Scores for Customer
 * (Value in Percentage)", and there the label and the value are SEPARATE SIBLING screen
 * fields — two rich-text blocks in one column, the label in the first and a bare "NA" or
 * "72" in the next, with an empty spacer block between them.
 *
 * So there is no label-to-value relationship for getFieldValue to follow: it looks for the
 * value inside or beside the label's own form element, and here the value is a different
 * element with no connection to the label but its position. Hence a dedicated reader.
 *
 * These two matter because the closure workflow turns on them — an N/A or a score under 100
 * is what makes a case a self-recovery — so a layout that carries them and a reader that
 * cannot see them is the same thing as a case with no NPS at all, which is the one state
 * the closure directive must never be told.

 * "Status" and so on, so the columns are read by NAME rather than by position.
 * That matters because the engineer chooses their own columns and order — reading
 * the 5th cell would work until someone dragged a column.
 *
 * Rows are read from the DOM, so this reflects the list view as displayed: the
 * filter, the sort and the row limit are whatever Salesforce is showing. That is
 * the intended behaviour — "my open cases" means the list the engineer curated,
 * not every case in the org.

 * every cell names its own column with `data-label="Case Number"`. That is what a CASE list
 * view renders. It is not what a KNOWLEDGE list view renders.
 *
 * Knowledge is still served by the older Aura component — `forceListViewManager` around a
 * `table.uiVirtualDataTable` — and that grid has neither attribute. Its rows carry no key and
 * its cells carry no labels at all; the only thing linking a cell to a column is its POSITION
 * under the header row:
 *
 *     <thead><tr><th title="Article Title"> <th title="Summary"> …
 *     <tbody><tr><th scope="row">…</th> <td>…</td> …
 *
 * That single difference is the whole of the "Sync knowledge" bug. Both list views opened
 * perfectly and then matched zero rows, so the scrape returned an empty array and the panel
 * could only conclude the list views did not exist.
 *
 * So: a row selector that is the union of the two shapes, and a cell reader that falls back
 * from the label to the position. The case path is untouched — an LWC row still resolves its
 * cells by name on the first try and never reaches the positional code.

 * and the caller cannot tell "unticked" from "this layout does not render it in a way I can
 * read" — which for the escalation trigger is the difference between closing a case normally

 *
 * The alt is the value, and it is the right thing to trust: it is what Salesforce puts there
 * for a screen reader, so it is the field's own word for the state rather than a colour this
 * file has decided to infer from an image. The title is a fallback for orgs that set one
 * instead, and the image FILE ID is the last resort — an org that ships the icons with no
 * alt text at all still has three distinct ids, so the colours can at least be told apart
 * even when they cannot be named.
 *
 * Normalised to one of green / yellow / red, and '' for anything else. An unrecognised value

/* ===========================================================================
 * READING A KNOWLEDGE LIST VIEW TO THE END
 * ===========================================================================
 * The sync was reading ten articles out of a list of two hundred and forty, and reporting a
 * finished knowledge base. Everything downstream was correct — the ten it read, it read
 * properly — so nothing about the result looked wrong except its size.
 *
 * Three separate things were wrong here, and each one on its own is enough to cause it:
 *
 *   1. THE SCRAPE HAPPENED ONCE, AT THE END. `table.uiVirtualDataTable` is called virtual
 *      because it is: rows are materialised in animation-frame batches as the grid is
 *      scrolled, and older ones can be dropped again behind you. Scrolling to the bottom and
 *      then reading the DOM asks the grid for a photograph of a moment, when what is needed
 *      is everything that was ever on screen. So the rows are ABSORBED every round now, keyed
 *      on record id, and the answer is the union — which is right whether the grid appends,
 *      recycles, or re-renders itself wholesale between rounds.
 *
 *   2. IT JUMPED STRAIGHT TO THE BOTTOM. One `scrollTop = scrollHeight` per round skips over
 *      every band in between, and a virtualised grid never renders the rows it was never
 *      scrolled past. It walks down a screenful at a time now, and only jumps to the bottom
 *      once it is already there — which is where the infinite loader lives.
 *
 *   3. IT STOPPED AT THE END OF A PAGE. "100+ items" was discarded as an unknown total (it
 *      is), and with it went the fact that there are more than a hundred. Four quiet rounds
 *      at the foot of the first page therefore looked exactly like the end of the list. The
 *      floor from declaredListSize makes the difference: below it, quiet means "still
 *      fetching", not "finished".
 *
 * Bounded on rounds, on the clock, and on patience, because a page that will not load must
 * still end the sync rather than hold it open forever.

     * This was read once, here, before the first scroll, and that single read is how a sync
     * of a nine-hundred-article knowledge base could stop at a few hundred and report a
     * clean finish. The status line is not a constant: Salesforce writes "50+ items" when
     * the first page lands, then "200+ items", "450+ items" as the scroll pulls more, and
     * finally an EXACT "939 items" once it has them all. Read once, at the only moment it
     * says the least, and the floor is fifty forever — so from row fifty-one onwards the
     * loader is running on its weakest stopping rule ("nothing new for eight rounds"), and
     * one slow page fetch in the middle of the list ends the scrape as `no-new-rows`, which
     * is the reason it prints for a list it genuinely finished.
     *
     * Re-read, the same sentence does the two jobs it was always supposed to do: the floor
     * RISES as rows arrive, so quiet below it always means "still fetching" and buys the
     * doubled patience; and the exact count, when it finally appears, ends the scroll on
     * `all-rows-loaded` — the only reason of the six that is proof rather than inference.
     *
     * Monotonic on purpose. The status line is re-rendered mid-scroll and can flicker back
     * to a smaller figure or to nothing at all between two reads; a floor that could fall is
     * a floor that stops holding at exactly the moment it matters. */

 * WRITING TO THE CASE — the publisher at the top of the Feed tab
 * ============================================================================

 * writes to it, and that difference governs how it is built.
 *
 * A scrape that misreads a field produces a wrong answer in a panel, which the
 * engineer can see and ignore. A write that goes to the wrong place puts a note
 * on somebody else's case, in the customer's timeline, under the engineer's
 * name — so every step here either finds exactly what it was looking for or
 * stops and says which step it was. Nothing is assumed to have worked because
 * a click did not throw: the note is confirmed by the composer EMPTYING, which
 * is the page's own signal that it accepted the record.
 *
 * Two things go through the publisher and they are different UIs behind one
 * idea:
 *
 *   LOG A CALL builds a Task. Its tab shows a stub with an "Add" button that
 *   expands the real form, and that form has a Subject picklist and a Comments
 *   textarea — both Aura, both driven by events rather than by assignment.
 *
 *   POST writes a Chatter FeedItem into a Quill rich-text editor, which keeps
 *   its own model of the document and will not notice a value written straight
 *   into the DOM. It is typed with execCommand for that reason, which needs the
 *   tab to be FOCUSED — the panel activates it before asking (see
 *   postToSalesforceFeed in sidepanel.js).
 *
 * Neither drives the page blind: the record root is resolved from the id the
 * panel names, exactly as a one-case read is, so a console with six cases open
 * writes to the one the panel is showing rather than the leftmost one.
 * ========================================================================== */

 * BACK TO THE TOP OF THE RECORD — what the publisher needs before it can be driven
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The publisher (Post / Log a Call / Email) sits at the very top of the case feed. Read any
 * distance down a long case and it is hundreds of pixels above the viewport — and on a case
 * with months of history Lightning may have recycled it out of the DOM altogether rather
 * than merely scrolled it away. Either way "Write a Post" reported "No Post tab is on this
 * case's publisher" about a publisher that was right there, and the only workaround was for
 * the engineer to scroll Salesforce up by hand before pressing the button.
 *
 * `findPublisherTab`'s isRenderedIgnoringScroll pass covers the first of those two — a
 * publisher that is merely off-screen. It cannot cover the second, because an element that
 * is not in the DOM cannot be found by any test. So the page is put back where the publisher
 * lives before anything is looked for.
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT NAMED — the same decision, and the same reasoning, as nudgeRecordScroll a
 * few hundred lines down: the first version of that looked for the container classes a
 * Lightning record page is BELIEVED to scroll in and guessed wrong on the very page it was
 * written for. `isScrollable` asks the element instead (computed overflow, more content than
 * box), which is true whatever the org calls its containers, and it is the same question the
 * feed auto-loader has always asked.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT PUT THE SCROLL BACK, and that is the one way it differs from every other
 * scroller in this file. nudgeRecordScroll restores the position because its whole job is to
 * mount sections invisibly; here the engineer PRESSED a button that writes to the case, the
 * composer they are about to see is at the top, and scrolling them away from the box they
 * are typing into would be the bug rather than the fix.
 *
 * Returns how many scrollers actually moved, so the caller can tell "the page was already at
 * the top" from "the page was moved" without asking twice.

/* HAS THIS FIELD ANSWERED YET — which is a different question from "is it empty",

 *
 * A Lightning record layout mounts in two stages. The FIELD BOXES come up first,
 * label and all, carrying `data-target-selection-name` and matching every selector
 * accountFieldBox uses; the VALUES arrive afterwards, when the record data lands.
 * For the seconds in between, "Backup TAM" is on the page with nothing in it — and
 * personFromFieldBox reports exactly what it reports for an account that genuinely
 * has no backup TAM: null.
 *
 * `fieldsSeen` therefore counts the SKELETON, and the panel's readiness test used
 * it as though it counted the answer: seven boxes on the page ended the poll, the
 * reader tab was closed, and whichever lookups had resolved by then — in practice
 * the Account Owner and the TAM — were reported as the whole account team, cached
 * for fifteen minutes, and Cc'd. That is the "only two people" bug.
 *
 * `<span class="not-navigable">` is the signal that separates them, and it is worth
 * being precise about why: that span is how `force-lookup` renders a lookup whose
 * value it HAS and which is blank — it is on both unfilled aligned-engineer fields
 * of the record this was written against, sitting exactly where the avatar and the
 * User link sit on the filled ones. A lookup still waiting on the record data has
 * neither: the control is empty, or the `force-lookup` is not there at all.
 *
 * So the marker is asked for RATHER THAN the wrapper. A bare `force-lookup` with
 * no link and no blank marker in it is a shell, and calling that "resolved" would
 * put the whole weight back on a timer — which is the thing this exists to replace.
 *
 * Text layouts (Classic's detail table, a formula field carrying the name) render
 * no `force-lookup` ever, so any text in the control counts as an answer too. An
 * empty field on one of those layouts has no positive marker to offer and is read
 * as still loading, which costs the caller time and never costs it people: the
 * painted pass runs its full budget and returns whoever is there.

/* OPEN THE Cc ROW AND HAND BACK ITS BOX.
 *
 * WHY THIS WAITS, which is the whole of the fix for "no Cc field could be found
 * or revealed". This used to ask its questions ONCE, in the tick it was called,
 * and every one of them can be truthfully answered "no" by a composer that is
 * simply not finished rendering. writeEmailDraft's own wait is satisfied by the
 * FIRST of a body editor, a stub button or a recipient box — and the TinyMCE
 * iframe is routinely up before the Aura recipient row is. So on a slow case the
 * sequence ran: body editor appears, the wait resolves, this function finds no Cc
 * box (true), no To box (true), no toggle (true), and reports a composer with no
 * Cc field on it. Nothing was wrong with the page. The question was asked too
 * early, and asked only once.
 *
 * Now it is asked until the deadline, and the states are still told apart rather
 * than guessed at:
 *
 *   ALREADY OPEN — the engineer opened it, or the case's own settings show it by
 *   default. Clicking the toggle here would HIDE the row, taking any recipients
 *   already in it with it. Re-checked at the top of every pass for that reason.
 *
 *   CLOSED, with a toggle — the normal state. Click it, then wait for a
 *   recipient box that was NOT there before: that box is the Cc box. Identifying
 *   it by what appeared is stronger than identifying it by its label, because it
 *   is a fact about this click rather than a guess about this org's markup.
 *
 *   NO TOGGLE YET — either the row has not rendered at all, or it is a layout
 *   that grows its toggles on focus. Nudge it and look again.
 *
 *   NO TOGGLE AND NO LABEL, but two boxes — a layout that renders To and Cc with
 *   nothing to press. Then the second box is Cc, by the same fixed order that
 *   makes the first one To.
 *
 * A SECOND CLICK IS ONLY EVER SENT TO A TOGGLE THAT DID NOTHING. If the box count
 * grew, the row opened — take it, labelled or not. Clicking a toggle that worked
 * would collapse the row again, which is the one mistake in here that would look
 * exactly like success.

     * actually there — a refresh that is scraped mid-flight reads the OLD grid and gains
     * nothing at all:

     *   • the spinner is waited out (waitWhileFetching), which is the reliable signal on this
     *     grid and the same one the scroll loader already trusts;
     *   • and it is bounded end to end. A refresh that never resolves must degrade to
     *     "sync what is on screen", which is exactly what the old behaviour was — so the
